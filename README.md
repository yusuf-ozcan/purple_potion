# 🧪 Purple Potion: My Elixir Learning Journey

Welcome to **Purple Potion**! This repository is a collection of my projects as I explore the functional world of [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Instead of just one tool, this is an evolving **Learning Roadmap** that demonstrates my progress from basics to more complex functional structures.

## 🎯 Learning Roadmap & Progress

- [x] **Phase 1: Functional Foundations** - Pattern Matching, Immutability, and Modules.
- [x] **Phase 2: Data Manipulation** - Pipe operators (`|>`), recursion, and working with Lists/Maps.
- [x] **Phase 3: Persistence** - Saving and loading data from the local file system using binary terms.
- [ ] **Phase 4: Concurrency** - Exploring Processes, Tasks, and Agents (Next Step).
- [ ] **Phase 5: Web Development** - Building real-time applications with the Phoenix Framework.
